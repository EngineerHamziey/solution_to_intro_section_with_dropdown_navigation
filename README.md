## Welcome to my solution Readme :relaxed:

This is a solution to the [Intro section with dropdown navigation challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-ryaPetHE5). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
-  use keyboard(tab key) or mouse to interact with all navavigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See focus states and hover states for all interactive elements on the page

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

<!-- ## My process -->

### My custom features and style
- My navigation links and image hover style on desktop:<br>
  ***I use javaScript mouse-tracking to add a dark circle behind each nav links and the dark circle follows the, the same is done on the image using grayscale backdrop***
- I used SVG for the text/logo "snap" and animates it.
- I added the Skip to main content button to make navigation easier for disabled people who can't use mouse but tab only.
***Below are list of thing***


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS using SCSS syntax format
- JavaScript

### What I Have Learnt

- The Importance of the "skip to main content" button.

- How to create an accessible expandable Menu by:
  1. Updating the Arial-expanded property of the button as needed to help screenreader users to know when the expandable menu is expanded
  <br>and 
  1. Making every button focusable.

- How to use BEM class naming convention.

### Continued development

I planed to build more Frontend Mentor projects using vanilla JavaScript before learning React and other frameworks/library
I believe in "taking a step at a time" and "The slow and steady win the race"

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
