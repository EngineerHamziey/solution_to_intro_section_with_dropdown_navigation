- what do you think of my code? is it clean? if know what do you recommend?

- I put some effort trying to make sure no details is left out.
do you notice any details left out?(like color, font, etc).

- Is there anything I did that you have a better way of doing? 

- in what aspect of my code do you think I should Improve on

- Is it inaccessible in anyway or Is there anything left out?

- I assume this site of mine conform to WCAG 2.2, Do you think there something left out? what is that?

- do you think it's a good idea to always use ID to select element from the javaScrip(I mean for DOM manipulation)

-- I ensure that all clickables are atleast 44px x 44px(to help people with dexterity needs and others), some might appear like they are not up to that but there is actually a hidden/transparent padding around it that make it up to 44px x 44px(like in my hamburger button).   do you think this voids the accessibility of the button?

- I hope it's completely responsive on mobile your phone.

- I have seen alot of people animate their middle hamburger, so I tried mine unique, do you like it  


how I ensure it's accessible:(Read how to write accessibility report for a website)
- I added the skip to main content button.
- I ensure that all buttons/target size are atleast 44px x 44px, some might appear like they are not up to that but there is actually a hidden/transparent padding around it that make it up to 44px x 44px.
