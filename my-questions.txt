Hello there 
my post on Frontend mentor

- Here are my questions:
  - do you think it's a good idea to always use ID only to select element from the javaScrip without a special reason(I mean for DOM manipulation)?

  - please do you know why the skip to main content isn't showing on firefox browser?

  - Is it inaccessible in anyway or Is there any accessibility feature you think I should add?

  - in what aspect of my code do you think I should Improve on?

  - Is there anything I did that you have a better way of doing? 

  - what do you think of my code? is it clean? Kindy tell how I can Improve that?

  - do you notice any details left out in the design and How do think I can fix it?
